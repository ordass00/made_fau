# Project Work - CO2 Emissions and Temperature Rise: A Global and Regional Analysis
Climate change poses a critical threat to global ecosystems, economies, and societies. Understanding the relationship between CO2 emissions and global temperature rise is essential in addressing climate change, as it impacts not only the global environment but also the economic stability and health of societies worldwide. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the correlation between CO2 emissions and temperature anomalies on a global level, and then breaking it down for 
selected countries on a regional scale. By investigating these trends over time, this study provides insights into the effectiveness of regional policies and identifies areas where more effective strategies must be developed to mitigate the effects of climate change. 

In this report, the following key topics are analyzed: 
1. How have global CO2 emissions and temperature anomalies developed over the years? 
2. How are global and regional CO2 emissions and temperature anomalies correlated?

*Note: In this report, “global” refers to analyses conducted on a worldwide and continental scale, while “regional” 
refers to analyses conducted on a few selected countries.*
